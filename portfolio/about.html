<p class="about-text">Hi
    Im a New Zealand based freelance web developer. I also work part-time at CloudCannon as a Support Engineer.
    <br>
    <br>
    I build websites for clients using Jekyll and the CloudCannon CMS. What sets me apart is the ability for my clients
    to edit and update their sites without using a lick of HTML or CSS.
    <br>
    <br>
    My clients use the CloudCannon Content Management System
    to seamlessly make changes to their sites. Contact me to find out more!
